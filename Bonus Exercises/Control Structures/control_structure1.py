#Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and
#assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

#•Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message
#that the player just earned 5 points.

#•Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The
#version that fails will have no output.)

if alien_color == "green": #if alien color is green then the message below will be printed
    print("You have just earned 5 points , Congrats") #message will be printed once the program runs
