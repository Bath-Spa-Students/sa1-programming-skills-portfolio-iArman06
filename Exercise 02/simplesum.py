#Exercise 2: Simple Sums

 #Adding the value to the first Variable var1
var1 = 50

 #Adding the value to second Variable var2
var2 = 95

#Adding both the variables values 
sum = var1 + var2  #sum is a third variable which stores the result of var1 + var2 i.e, 50 + 95

#Result 
print (f'The sum of the given values is: {sum}')
#The result will be 50+95 which is 145
