#poem 1#
print("""1. Machli Jal ki rani hai , Jeevan uski paani hai
                    Haath lagago dar jayegi 
                    Bahar Nikalo Mar Jayegi""")
#poem 2#
print("""2. In Kerala's land, where coconuts sway,
            Mallus drink chai ten times a day.
            With lungis tied and fish in hand,
            They dream of Gulf trips, oh so grand!""")
#poem 3#
print("""3. A Bengali with dreams of the moon,
            Packed a fish curry, and a spoon.
            But halfway there, he had to stop,
            Too busy with his Tuna chop!""")
